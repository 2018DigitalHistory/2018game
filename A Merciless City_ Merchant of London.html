</script><tw-passagedata pid="1" name="Prologue" tags="" position="846,108" size="100,100">Welcome to London! It is the 14th century, in the reign of our King, Richard II. You are Hugh Bradley, son of William the Fishmonger. Born in 1364, christened Hugh Thomas Bradley, you are claimed by godparents, Thomas and Jessica. As the second son of the family, you will not inherit the fishing business from your father, and thus have been apprenticed to John Organ, a prominent mercer in the city.

The Mercery is a powerful guild. They predominantly sell textiles, such as your master who sells fine silks and linens to the aristocrats and churchmen. You will soon join their ranks, and have the oppurtunity to own your own business, raise a family, and gain wealth and power.

Your goal is simple: excel at your profession, become a respectable member of society, and maintain good relations with all aspects of London life. London is based upon personal relationships, a fabric that works so long as everyone understands their role.

But first, you must understand your origins, a taste of what is to come.

[[Your journey begins here -&gt;The Beginning]]

You have completed the tutorial. The last option was to give you a taste of what will ultimately determine your fate. You may have noticed the panel of different terms at the bottom. Those are your Pillars. Most choices in the game will raise or lower those Pillars, and you must be aware that choices have consequences on the end of your game.

For example, your choice raised your Religion Pillar by 1. Do not feel pressured to make choices based solely on the Pillars, but if one were to fall to 0, your journey will end immediately. 

Good luck, Hugh Bradley, and may your journey yield great results. [†]

London. In the Year of Our Lord 1390.

It has been a harsh winter. King Richard has been placed under arrest by the Lords Appellant of Parliament, after he attempted to negotiate peace with our hated enemy the French. His advisors are now being hunted down for execution, and the royalty are in an uproar. But life goes on in the city, sure to be untouched by such events... [†]

Hugh Bradley, you are now the owner of your own business, having been given full membership to the guild. Your former master has imparted much help, and you have strong connections with the Italian and Flemish merchants to acquire the silk so high in demand among both royalty and London elite. Your wife, Elizabeth, is pregnant with your first child. You are quickly establishing yourself as a prominent member of both the guild and society, but will your choices maintain an upward trend?

Tip: There will be encounters in which death or failure is a possibility. Sometimes, the failure is predetermined; othertimes, the randomness of fate shall decide your path.

Your Master, John Organ, sells expensive textiles, fancy silk and woven linen. 

Master Organ calls you over. 

&quot;Hugh, I need you to take this linen to the parish. Do not get soft-hearted on your way there boy, and you know what I mean.&quot;

You fly out of the shop, glad to be free. The air smells of the River Thames, which means it smells of human waste and dead animals. Nevertheless, it is gratifying to escape into the open air.

&quot;Wake Up Lad!&quot;

You slowly begin to wake, dreading another day of chores. Nonetheless, you are an apprentice and have no choice in the matter, if you ever wish to become as wealthy and powerful as your master.

[[Pull yourself out of bed -&gt;The Choice]]

You live above the shop with your master and his family, so the people of the neighborhood are a familiar sight.

Just before turning the corner to the church, Constance the huckster, a seller of small goods, comes over and lights up upon seeing the sheet of linen in your hands.

&quot;Ahhhh Huey,&quot; she croons, &quot;Perhaps you can give me just a snippet of your cloth? You know the winter is coming and my dearest child needs new clothes. Please m&#39;love, Father Raymond won&#39;t notice a morsel of fabric gone.&quot;

Your heart is torn, knowing your master has given strict instructions, but Constance has been rejected from the mercer&#39;s guild for being a woman with no inheritance. What to do? [†]

His church, St. Vedast, your local parish, is always sweltering hot in the summer, and your new shipment from the Flemish has been &quot;guaranteed to reject Satan&#39;s flames.&quot;

&quot;Huey, my boy,&quot; Father Burke says, &quot;I have something that may rather interest you. The church needs a [[new altar cloth]], silk is my preference. The Lord demands the best from his mortal servants.&quot;

You feel a twinge of guilt. You have silk, but it has been reserved by Lady Strange, the Earl of Nottingham&#39;s wife, for [[a new dress]].

You have survived a truly tumultuous time in the city of London, and that is no small feat in of itself! Through royal upheaval, plague, religious pressure, and guild reputation, you should now have a basic taste of the London experience, and living in it during the 14th century.

The story of London, and much of history, is the formation of personal relationships and how they crafetd a larger society. Battles and kings are only a mere fraction of the human experience, and being a merchant and mayor in London is a small example of the vast majority. 

You will soon learn of your fate in each of the Pillars. Even if the game yielded negative results in some of the Pillars, know that you have not failed. To chase power, or be truly holy, or maintain your family, all required sacrifices in other aspects of your lfie. If you were able to fluorish in all the Pillars, then perhaps you are truly a person of history, one who will be remembered above all others. The passage of time will render your individual choices forgotten, but the deeds inspired by your choice could render you great.

You may continue on here to learn about each of your pillars.
